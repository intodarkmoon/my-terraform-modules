1. Updating Files Locally and Pushing to GitHub
Whenever you make updates to your files in the terraform folder, you can follow these steps to push the changes to GitHub:

Stage the updated files:

bash
Copy code
git add .
Commit the changes with a message describing what you updated:

bash
Copy code
git commit -m "Describe the update made to the terraform files"
Pull the latest changes from GitHub to ensure you’re up to date:

bash
Copy code
git pull origin darkmoon --rebase
This step prevents conflicts by making sure your local branch has the latest changes from GitHub.
If there are merge conflicts, Git will notify you. Resolve any conflicts, then proceed with the commit.
Push the changes to GitHub:

bash
Copy code
git push
2. Using a New Device to Access the Latest Files from GitHub
If you’re on a new device or laptop, here’s how to get the latest version of your repository:

Clone the repository from GitHub:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-github-username/your-repo-name.git
This will create a folder named your-repo-name (or you can rename it by specifying a different folder name after the URL).
Change directories into the newly cloned repository:
bash
Copy code
cd your-repo-name
Switch to your branch (if necessary): If you’re working on a specific branch like darkmoon, switch to it:

bash
Copy code
git checkout darkmoon
Make updates as usual: After cloning, you can make changes, commit, and push as you would on your original device.

Regular Workflow on the New Device: When updating the files on this new device, use the same workflow as before:

Stage changes: git add .
Commit changes: git commit -m "update message"
Pull any recent updates: git pull origin darkmoon --rebase
Push updates: git push
By following these steps, your local repository and GitHub repository will remain synchronized, and you’ll be able to switch between devices while keeping everything up-to-date.
